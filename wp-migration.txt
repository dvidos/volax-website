On images migration
-----------------------
- our images are located in /uploads
- wp wants media root to be somewhere under the wp directory
- after trying to mark it outside (volax.gr/uploads and wp in volax.gr/wp/) it did not play nice.
- so, i decided the following:
    1. we will copy the files from uploads to wp/wp-content/uploads
    2. we shall use the "Media Sync" plugin to import that data (it creates thumbs as well)
    3. we shall use the "Better Search Replace" plugin to update URLs in posts.
    4. we lose the owner of the file, but... 


Not to forget:
---------------------
* custom css rules, like "low-text" or "alt-text".
* redirection rules for existing links
* short codes for [gallery], [video], [audio]
* fixing the [more] short towards the excerpt in WP
* assigning the main picture of a post.
* fixing peripheral menus, such as on the header and footer (home, search, tags, who are we etc)
