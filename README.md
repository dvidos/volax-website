# The volax.gr project

This project is what is running behind the volax.gr website. It is a custom written blog style website, based on the yii framework.

# History

The website was first created on May 2008. A very simple php script was written to spit out pre-formatted html files.

Shortly after a volax-tinos.gr website was created by similar minded people. It was using asp technology and was mainly static.

The winter of 2013 we decided to merge the two websites and allow for collaboration from more than one persons.

At 2018 we decided to upload the code to github, to allow collaboration from more than one developers too.
